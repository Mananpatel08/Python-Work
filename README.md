# Python Work Repository

This repository showcases a collection of Python scripts and projects Iâ€™ve worked on, covering a wide range of tasks such as automation, gesture-based control and data processing. The code utilizes popular libraries like OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and more. Each script is designed to solve specific problems, from creating interactive applications to automating tasks. This repository serves as a learning resource and a portfolio for my Python programming journey. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
